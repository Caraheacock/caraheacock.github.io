        <p>Catalog Choice is a non-profit organization that helps people opt out of paper junk mail. With over 2 million users, Catalog Choice is by far the largest scale and most complex project I have worked on.</p>
        <p>This robust application was made possible by a team of full-time, part-time, and contract developers at Big Wheel Brigade including myself, and a graphic designer. As well as working on some of the back-end functionality, I coded almost all of the front-end styles. Due to the large scale of the application, I kept the SASS extremely organized and modular so we could easily find, add, edit, and reuse styles and components.</p>

        <p>Water Bear Games is an Omaha-based tabletop games company, owned by my cousin Marcus Ross and myself. It started as an <a href="http://omaha.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Omaha Startup Weekend</a> project, and we have been continuing to work on games outside of our day jobs because we like it so much. Our most well-known game is <a href="http://waterbeargames.com/games/discount-salmon/" target="_blank">Discount Salmon</a>, which won Cards Against Humanity's first season of <a href="http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/deathmatch/" target="_blank">Tabletop Deathmatch</a>.</p>
        <p>I created the original Water Bear Games website in 2013, back when I only knew HTML and CSS. After attending Omaha Code School in early 2014 and becoming a much better developer <em>and</em> designer, the Water Bear Games website was this ghost from my past that was slowly killing me inside, and I was embarrassed to say I created it. Now I've designed and developed the current site (you can <a href="http://waterbeargames.com/2016/02/new-website-and-new-logo/" target="_blank">read a blog post about that experience here</a>), and it looks infinitely better. With the help of WordPress we can easily edit content, write blog posts, and add more games as our company grows.</p>
        <p>Also the animated bubbles in the home page header background make me inordinately amused. I have simple needs.</p>

        <p>Side Projects Club is an Omaha-based meetup that I started. Its mission is to help people work on their side projects in a group setting by providing a space, scheduled times, and accountability. Since founding it in September 2015, there are now two chapters: one in Omaha, and one in Kansas City run independently of me.</p>
        <p>I'm a very ambitious person with a lot of ideas and side projects, but I had trouble making myself work on them. I have a friend that I videochat with once a week where we screenshare and work on our projects and hold each other accountable, and I found I was getting a lot more done during my weekly hangouts with her than I was on my own and decided to introduce the idea to a large group setting.</p>
        <p>The Side Projects Club website was the first website I created in a while that was 100% my personal aesthetic, and it was very fun to illustrate the SVGs and design and build it all myself.</p>

        <p>PathWise is a financial advisory firm and a client of Blu Giant. I coded almost all of the PathWise WordPress theme myself from a static design. Some challenges with this theme included integrating a Wistia video in the background of the home page header. This site also includes a page builder that I built myself so the client can easily add sections and edit content.</p>

        <p>Nova was created as an alternative solution to Blu Giant&rsquo;s custom built websites. Nova themes came with the ability to edit colors, the navigation bar and footer, the logo, pages, and sections on pages. All the Nova themes came with a page builder that I coded myself from the ground up, which allowed clients to easily add and edit content, backgrounds, icons, buttons, and more.</p>
        <p>The Nova themes were my pet project during my time at Blu Giant. I enjoyed the challenge of creating themes that have just enough customization to allow clients to insert their brands as well as easily be able to edit content, colors, and imagery.</p>

        <p>Omawho is a social media website specifically for the Omaha creative community. The redesign of the Omawho website was the largest group project I participated in during Omaha Code School. I was appointed technical manager and oversaw five other students. I reviewed their code and maintained quality assurance, as well as contributing to the front-end and illustrating the Omaha skyline for the header.</p>
