# Cara Heacock's Portfolio

## About

This is the repo for [my portfolio site](http://caraheacock.github.io/). When my 12 week experience in the inaugural [Omaha Code School](http://omahacodeschool.com/) class was coming to a close, I wanted to redo my portfolio site completely to showcase all my new work and skills.

## Technical Stuff

I'm a weirdo who's obsessed with clocks. (In high school I was such a nerd that I used to wear up to 4 clocks on one arm, each for a different time zone in the continental US.) I've always wanted to know enough Javascript to code a clockface. Before Omaha Code School, I only knew HTML and CSS, and my Javascript skills were limited to googling how someone else did something and copying and pasting the code into my site.

So I'm very excited about my Javascript clock in the background of the site. If you check out my portfolio site at different times of day (or if you're a savvy enough coder to just cheat and read the code in **js/main.js** and **css/colormagic.css**), you'll notice a small surprise. :)

There's also [Lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) implementation to display the work in my portfolio. Lightbox is incredibly easy to add to your site, and I highly recommend it.
